    Estimate the quantity based on the price paid and typical market prices. Provide rough estimates for nutritional content and environmental impact based on this estimated quantity. If certain information is not applicable or available, you may omit those fields. Focus on providing a general nutritional and environmental overview rather than precise values.

    For each metric:
    1. Nutrient Density Score: Calculate based on vitamin, mineral, fiber, and protein content relative to calorie content.
    2. Glycemic Index and Load: Assess these values, noting that foods like lentils and pulses typically have low values.
    3. Protein Quality: Evaluate using PDCAAS or DIAAS metrics where possible.
    4. Fiber Content: Analyze both quantity and type (soluble vs. insoluble).
    5. Phytonutrient Profile: Assess the presence of beneficial compounds like polyphenols, flavonoids, and antioxidants.
    6. Micronutrient Density: Compare vitamin and mineral content per 100 calories and per 100 grams.
    7. Satiety Index: Provide an estimate of how filling the food is relative to its calorie content.
    8. Environmental Impact: Include metrics on water usage, carbon footprint, and land use for production.
    9. Versatility Score: Develop a score based on the food's adaptability to various dishes and cuisines.
    10. Cost-Nutrient Ratio: Calculate the nutritional value provided per unit of cost.

    List all edible products from the invoices in this format, highlighting the nutritional benefits of foods like lentils, pulses, and other nutrient-dense options.
